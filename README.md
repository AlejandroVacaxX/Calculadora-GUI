# Calculator GUI


### Made for Alejandor Vaca with love.

To make this code work, use the command:

```fleet calc.py```

You'll also need to have the Flet framework installed; that's why I have two projects, the Discord one and this one. If you can't install Flet, you can check the Discord repository. Both made with love from Mexico.

This was the first project I did
https://github.com/AlejandroVacaxX/python_bot.git
It's a Discord bot using an API that searches for a picture of a dog. *_If you have time to review this repository, I would greatly appreciate it._*

 Even so, I decided I wanted something a bit more elaborate, and that's how the idea for this calculator came about. I used the Flet framework. What is Flet? It's an open-source framework for creating web, mobile, and desktop applications using only Python.

The calculator is simple; I followed the official Flet documentation to create it.



I apologize for my English.
